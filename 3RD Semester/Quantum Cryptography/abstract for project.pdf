In today era of technology, a secure way of communication is very vital between sender and receiver .Here in our scope of this paper we will going to focus on quantum 
cryptography a unique way  of data security that is uncrackable with today present technology.In our present time we are using the complex mathematical functions in our 
cryptographic algorithm but there reliability completely depends only on the mathematical functions reversibility.So the solution to this problem is given by quantum physics
which lead to new field of cryptography called quantum cryptography.Advances in quantum computing, can easily break this security by reverse computing keys faster than
 the conventional computers.So this paper is written as an endeavor to understand the fundamentals the quantum cryptography and having general idea about the advancement
and improvement in this technology.
